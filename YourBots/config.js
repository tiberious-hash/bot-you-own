  // when they aren't on the list yet. Mine out of the box; make it yours. Used by

  // step" of any bot whose project.json says "communityStep": true.

  // ---- 2. WHICH PROJECT OPENS FIRST ------------------------------------------
  // Every folder in YourBots/ that is listed in YourBots/index.js is available in
  // the sidebar. This one is selected when someone opens the page.
  // Ship ONE project to customers. The samples exist so you can test the machine

  defaultProject: "tour",

  // Hide the sidebar and show only the default project (for a customer-facing
  // deploy). The embed widget always behaves this way regardless.
  singleProject: false,

  // ---- 3. THE MODEL ----------------------------------------------------------
  // "workers-ai" needs NO API key — it's included with Cloudflare. Start here.
  // "openai" or "anthropic" need a secret (see docs/DEPLOY.md) and go through AI Gateway.
  provider: "workers-ai",
  model: "@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
  // model: "@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b",                    // reasoning model: thinks inside max_tokens, so a long
  //                                                      // input can eat the whole budget and answer nothing.
  // model: "@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast",   // an older default; passes the same set, pricier output
  // model: "gpt-4.1-mini",                    // provider: "openai"
  // model: "claude-opus-5",                   // provider: "anthropic"
  maxTokens: 900,

  // ---- 4. THE GATEWAY (on by default — the dollar ceiling) --------------------
  // Every model call goes through Cloudflare AI Gateway named below. You get
  // logs, caching, a per-minute rate limit and a DOLLAR SPEND LIMIT, all from the
  // dashboard, none of it in code. The gateway has to EXIST on your account
  // first: dashboard → AI → AI Gateway → Create Gateway, name it "bot-you-own"
  // (or the curl in docs/DEPLOY.md §D). Until it does, the bot notices, logs one
  // warning and talks to the model directly — a missing gateway never breaks a
  // chat. Under the hood → Gateway & model shows which way the last call went.
  gateway: {
    id: "bot-you-own",      // "" = talk to the model directly, no gateway
    accountId: "",          // only needed for provider "openai" / "anthropic"
    cacheTtl: 0,            // seconds; 0 = don't cache answers
  },

  // ---- 4a. CHEAP TURNS: "hi", "thanks", "ok" don't need a 120B model ----------
  // Engine/worker/router.js looks at the visitor's last message in plain code —
  // no model call — and if EVERY word is small talk (greeting, thanks, ok, bye,
  // an emoji) it answers with the small model below, same system prompt, 200
  // tokens. Anything with a question mark (strict bots), a number, an unknown
  // word or more than six words goes to the main model as always. When it
  // isn't sure, it's a real turn. Under the hood → Gateway & model shows the split.
  routing: {
    smallTurns: true,
    smallModel: "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fast",   // Workers AI catalogue: developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models
    smallMaxTokens: 200,
  },

  // ---- 5. WHO CAN USE IT -----------------------------------------------------
  // Each bot can say for itself in its project.json → "access". This is what a
  // bot gets when it doesn't say (default), and the most OPEN any bot may be (floor).
  // The modes, most open first:
  // "open"      — anyone with the link. For a public website bot.
  // "email"     — visitors type an email address once; that browser is remembered
  //               (Engine/identity/). Identification, not authentication: nobody checks it.
  // "allow"     — email, AND the address must be on the allowlist: this bot's own
  //               list or the one for every bot (Under the hood → Settings → Allowlist).
  //               Invited people only. Needs the ALLOWLIST_KEY secret (docs/DEPLOY.md → B2c).
  // "key"       — a shared passphrase (the ACCESS_PASSPHRASE secret). Demos, internal bots.
  // "key+email" — both: the passphrase to get in, then an email so you know who asked.
  // "admin"     — only the admin code opens it. Bots only you should talk to.
  // "draft"     — nobody but the Configure preview. Publish to open it.
  // floor: a bot is never more open than this. "open" = no floor. Set it to "key"
  // and EVERY bot needs the passphrase, whatever its file says — the panic switch.
  // If a bot wants a key but no ACCESS_PASSPHRASE secret exists, it runs open and
  // says so in the logs. The admin code (ADMIN_PASSPHRASE) is separate.
  // Under the hood → Settings changes both without a commit (the saved copy wins,
  // then YourBots/settings.json, then this). docs/CUSTOMIZE.md → "Who can use it".
  access: { default: "email", floor: "open" },

  // ---- 4b. DEMO MODE ---------------------------------------------------------
  // What ships in the box so a fresh deploy has something to click, and what a new
  // owner turns off once it is their site. Two switches because they go stale at
  // different times: the tour teaches YOUR site and sells the workshop it came from,
  // while the sample bots are just examples to copy. Someone may want the tour gone on
  // day one and keep Example Co as a reference, or exactly the other way round.
  // Both are presentation, not security — flip them in Settings, live, no redeploy.
  //   tour  false → no stop strip, no pointing finger, no $ badges, no intro modal.
  //                 The guide bot (YourBots/tour) stays; it just becomes a normal bot.
  //   bots  false → the sample bots (marked "demo": true) leave the sidebar. Nothing is
  //                 deleted: the folders stay, the owner can still open one by its link,
  //                 and switching this back brings them all straight back.
  demo: { tour: true, bots: true },

  // ---- 5. THE SIGN-UP GATE (what "email" mode asks for) --------------------------
  // Out of the box a visitor meets a welcome page: email, a mobile number, and two
  // opt-in boxes. Everything here can be changed live in Under the hood → Settings
  // (the saved copy wins). "required" | "optional" | "off" for the two fields.
  // The number is for texting them; turn it off and nobody is asked. The boxes are
  // never pre-ticked unless you say so — that is what makes the consent real.
  // Every sign-up is stored on the person's row (name, phone, what they ticked and
  // when, the exact words they ticked) and POSTed to signup.webhook if you set one,
  // so your list tool gets it live. Under the hood → Sign-ups shows them all, with
  // the abuse marks (same device or address handing out many emails, throwaway
  // domains) and a CSV. docs/CUSTOMIZE.md → "The sign-up gate".
  signup: {
    title: "Try it, free",
    blurb: "A ChatGPT-style assistant that runs on infrastructure the owner controls. Have a go, then see how it's made.",
    askName: "optional",           // "required" | "optional" | "off"
    askPhone: "required",          // "required" | "optional" | "off"   — the texting number
    marketing: { show: true, required: false, checked: false, text: "Email me the newsletter, workshop dates and the occasional offer. Unsubscribe any time." },
    sms: { show: true, required: false, checked: false, text: "Text me about this. Message rates may apply; reply STOP to end." },
    privacyLine: "We keep your email, your number if you give it, and a hashed record of your device and connection to spot abuse. Shared only with the tools we use to email or text you. Delete it any time.",   // the page adds Privacy · Terms links after it
    webhook: "",                   // POST every sign-up here (Zapier, Make, your CRM). Empty = off.
  },

  // ---- 5a. IDENTITY: the return window ----------------------------------------
  // A visitor in email/allow mode is remembered per browser (a device key). A
  // SECOND browser typing the same email normally waits for the owner to link it.
  // The return window is the exception: if that email was active within the last
  // graceMinutes, the new browser is trusted at once and their conversation
  // history follows them (it is kept on the server for identified visitors —
  // docs/IDENTITY.md → "History on any computer"). Closing the laptop and opening
  // the phone just works. The trade-off, said plainly: inside the window, anyone
  // who knows the email can pick up that person's recent conversation from their
  // own computer. 0 = off (every new browser waits for a link). A bot can set its
  // own in project.json → "identity": { "graceMinutes": 15 }. Passkeys and
  // Google/Microsoft/Apple sign-in are trusted on any device regardless.
  // Under the hood → Settings edits this without a commit, like access above.
  identity: { graceMinutes: -1 },   // -1 = never block a second device (the demo's choice); 0 = always wait for the owner; N = minutes

  // ---- 5b. WHEN ACCESS RUNS OUT -----------------------------------------------
  // An email, an invitation or a passphrase can have an END DATE. Nothing does by
  // default: leave this alone and every window is unlimited, exactly as before.
  // THREE things can carry a date, because they're three different promises:
  //   the PERSON      "Amy's twelve weeks end on the 3rd."  Under the hood →
  //                   Settings → When access runs out. Works wherever the visitor
  //                   is identified: email, allow, key+email, and Plate.
  //   the INVITATION  "this cohort is on the list until the course finishes."
  //                   Set it when you add them to the allowlist. Only bites in "allow".
  //   the PASSPHRASE  "the demo key dies on Friday." One date per ACCESS_PASSPHRASE*
  //                   secret. Handy for a client deploy you've been paid for once.
  // When more than one applies THE EARLIEST WINS, and the owner's screen says which.
  // Extending is the same screen: type a later date, or clear it for unlimited.
  // Every change is written to the admin record with the person's address on it, so
  // Settings → Access over time shows one person's whole history in order.
  expiry: {
    // What lapsing DOES. The whole point of it being a setting: a members' bot and a
    // coaching log want different things.
    //   "tell"     locked out, told the date it ended and pointed at your handoff contact
    //   "readonly" they can still READ their own history — the composer is off. Kindest
    //              when a coaching block ends: their food log doesn't vanish
    //   "silent"   refused as if they'd never been on the list. Gives nothing away
    onLapse: "tell",
    graceDays: 0,      // days past the end date before any of that bites. 3 = a long weekend to renew
    warnDays: 7,       // the visitor sees a countdown for this many days first. 0 = no warning
    // Give every NEW person this many days from the day they join. 0 = unlimited,
    // which is the old behaviour. 84 = a twelve-week block, and you never type a date.
    // It's a policy, not a stored date: change the number and everyone without a date
    // of their own moves with it. Giving one person an explicit date always wins.
    defaultDays: 0,
  },
  // A single bot can override any of the four in its project.json → "expiry", the
  // same way it overrides "access". docs/CUSTOMIZE.md → "When access runs out".

  // ---- 6. THE FIREWALL ---------------------------------------------------------
  // All enforced in code (Engine/worker/firewall.js). Each one fails OPEN: if it can't run,
  // the bot still answers. Read the file — you don't have to change it, you have
  // to know it's there.
  firewall: {
    blockInjections: true,   // "ignore your instructions…" never reaches the model
    stripLinks: true,        // only project.allowedLinks survive, enforced after the model answers
    blockPromptLeaks: true,  // an answer that quotes the rules is replaced with a refusal
    llamaGuard: false,       // extra Workers AI safety model on every turn (doubles cost). See docs/CUSTOMIZE.md
    maxTurns: 12,            // how much history the model sees
    maxChars: 4000,          // per message
  },

  // ---- 6a. THE LIBRARY: PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, transcripts, images ----
  // knowledge/*.md is bundled into the prompt — a few pages, word-for-word.
  // The library is for everything else: files go into Cloudflare AI Search and
  // the bot gets the relevant passages per question. Each bot only sees its own.
  // Two ways in: Configure → Documents, or drop files into YourBots/<bot>/knowledge/
  // and let the GitHub Action sync them. docs/CUSTOMIZE.md → "Give it documents".
  // Answers that used the library cite it: a 📄 chip per document under the reply
  // (names only — visitors never get the files).
  // A bot can also answer from its own WEBSITE: project.json → "website": { "url": … }.
  // Cloudflare crawls it into a second instance ("<name>-web-<bot>") and re-crawls
  // on the schedule below. Free plan: 500 pages a day. "Or point it at your website" in the docs.
  library: {
    name: "bot-you-own-library",   // the AI Search instance; created on first upload
    maxPassages: 6,                // excerpts per question, documents and web pages together. 4–8. More is not smarter.
    matchThreshold: 0.4,           // 0–1. Raise to 0.5 if it quotes unrelated documents.
    contextTurns: 2,               // earlier visitor messages added to the search, so "and on Thursdays?" finds the page. 0 = latest message only.
    scan: true,                    // scan every upload for emails, cards, keys, "CONFIDENTIAL"… before it goes in
    scanWithModel: true,           // …and ask the model "would a business put this on its website?" (one small call)
    crawlIntervalHours: 24,        // how often a bot's website is re-crawled. 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 or 24 (the values Cloudflare offers)
    crawlMaxPages: 200,            // pages per crawl. Keep it under the free plan's 500 a day; raise it on a paid plan
  },

  // ---- 6a-0. MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGE ---------------------------------------------
  // The model already speaks dozens of languages; nothing is translated. A visitor
  // who writes in Spanish gets a Spanish answer built from your English files.
  // The code guesses the visitor's language from their own words (no model call:
  // Engine/worker/language.js), tells the model, and keeps the guardrails working.
  // Detected: English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, and
  // by script Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Russian/Ukrainian, Hindi. Anything
  // else is treated as English. Your handoff contact line is never translated.
  // docs/CUSTOMIZE.md → "More than one language".
  languages: {
    mode: "visitor",             // "visitor" = reply in the visitor's language; "owner" = always in yours
    owner: "en",                 // the language your files and handoff line are written in (ISO code)
    allowed: [],                 // only these, e.g. ["en", "es"]. Empty = any. Others get a polite "I can help in…"
  },

  // ---- 6a'. VISITOR ATTACHMENTS: "here's my invoice, what does it say?" --------
  // The paperclip next to the send button. A visitor attaches ONE file (PDF,
  // Word, spreadsheet, text or an image) and the bot reads it for THAT
  // conversation only. Nothing is stored on the server: the text is read out,
  // checked, handed back to the visitor's browser and re-sent with each message
  // while the chat lasts — exactly like the chat history. It never goes into
  // the library and never becomes a fact about your business (strict grounding
  // still refuses anything about you that isn't in your own files).
  // Every attachment is screened: "ignore your instructions" inside a PDF is
  // refused, and so is anything that looks like a card number or a key.
  attachments: {
    enabled: true,               // false hides the paperclip and switches the route off
    max: 1,                      // files per conversation
    maxBytes: 4 * 1024 * 1024,   // 4 MB, Cloudflare's converter limit
    maxChars: 20000,             // the text is cut here (about 8 pages); the bot is told it was cut
    retentionDays: 30,           // an attached file's text is dropped from server-side chat copies after this many days
  },

  // ---- 6a-i. VOICE IN AND OUT: talk to it, and hear it back --------------------
  // The microphone next to the paperclip, and a small speaker on every reply.
  // IN:  press the mic, talk, press again (or wait for maxSeconds). The browser's
  //      own recorder sends the clip to /api/transcribe; Workers AI (Whisper)
  //      turns it into text; the text lands in the input box for the visitor
  //      to check and send. Nothing goes to Google or Apple — it's your Worker.
  // OUT: the speaker under a reply reads it aloud (/api/speak → a Deepgram Aura
  //      voice on Workers AI). Auto-speak in the header reads every reply; off
  //      by default and remembered per browser.
  // Every clip and every read-out is a normal Workers AI call on your account,
  // through the same door and rate limit as the chat. Nothing is stored.
  // What it costs (developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/platform/pricing, Sept 2026):
  //   whisper-large-v3-turbo  $0.0005 per audio MINUTE  (46.63 neurons/min)
  //   aura-1                  $0.015 per 1,000 CHARACTERS spoken (1,363.64 neurons/1k)
  //   aura-2-en               $0.030 per 1,000 characters — the newer voice, twice the price
  //   10,000 neurons a day are free. A 30-second question is a quarter of a cent;
  //   a 400-character answer read aloud is six-tenths of a cent.
  // Model ids and voice names are on developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/.
  voice: {
    enabled: true,                                 // false hides the mic and the speakers and switches both routes off
    sttModel: "@cf/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo", // speech → text. Also on the catalogue: @cf/openai/whisper (older, same shape)
    ttsModel: "@cf/deepgram/aura-1",               // text → speech. @cf/deepgram/aura-2-en for the newer voice
    ttsVoice: "asteria",                           // aura-1 voices: angus (default), asteria, arcas, orion, orpheus, athena, luna, zeus, perseus, helios, hera, stella
    maxSeconds: 60,                                // the mic stops itself here
    maxChars: 1500,                                // a reply longer than this is read up to here (about 90 seconds of speech)
  },

  // ---- 6a-ii. WHEN IT HANDS OFF, TELL SOMEONE ----------------------------------
  // Each bot chooses a webhook and/or an email in its project.json → "handoffActions"
  // (Configure → "When it hands off, tell someone"). Email needs the send_email
  // binding in wrangler.jsonc AND a "from" address on a domain you've onboarded to
  // Cloudflare Email Sending. Empty = emails are skipped (webhooks still work).
  // docs/CUSTOMIZE.md → "When it hands off, tell someone".
  handoffEmailFrom: "",            // e.g. "bot@yourdomain.com"

  // ---- 6a-iii. LEADS: who asked, and what they want ----------------------------
  // Needs email mode (access.mode "email" or "key+email") so visitors leave an
  // address. Under the hood → Leads lists every visitor with their turns and
  // refusals, and can write an AI brief per lead: what they asked, their
  // situation, what they care about, objections, the next step, a 0–100 score
  // with the reason. Stored in D1, refreshed on demand. No email is sent from
  // here — a lead is pushed to the bot's webhook (project.json → handoffActions
  // .webhook, or the one below) as event "lead-summary". docs/CUSTOMIZE.md → "Leads".
  leads: {
    autoAfterTurns: 4,             // summarise automatically at a visitor's 4th turn; 0 = only by hand
    notifyScore: 70,               // push to the webhook automatically when the score is at least this
    webhook: "",                   // fallback webhook for leads when the bot has none of its own
    maxTurns: 40,                  // how many of the visitor's most recent turns the summary reads
  },

  // ---- 6b. GITHUB (for "Commit to GitHub" on the Configure screen) --------------
  // The repo this bot deploys from. With the GITHUB_TOKEN secret set (a fine-grained
  // token with Contents: read & write on ONLY this repo), the Configure screen can
  // write a bot's folder straight into the repo. If the repo is connected to
  // Cloudflare Workers Builds, that commit redeploys the bot: the round trip.
  // Left EMPTY on purpose: the repo name is not in this file or in the page. Set the
  // GITHUB_REPO secret instead (printf 'you/your-repo' | npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_REPO).
  github: { repo: "", branch: "main" },

  // ---- 6d. LINKS THE APP HANDS OUT, KEPT OUT OF THE REPO ------------------------
  // The code, the owner walkthrough and the prompt library. Not here, not in the page:
  // set them live in Under the hood → Settings → Links. The page asks the Worker for
  // them (/api/tour) and gets the code and prompts once someone has signed up, the
  // walkthrough and the deploy button only if they may deploy. A grep of the app
  // finds nothing; a bot reading the page finds nothing.
  links: { code: "", checklist: "", prompts: "" },

  // ---- 6e. WORKSHOP KEYS: PREFIX-1234-5678. Make yours in Under the hood → Sign-ups. ------
  keys: { prefix: "SO" },   // letters only, up to 6 — the prefix says whose key it is

  // ---- 6c. THE FOOD LOG: /food — snap a plate, get the numbers ----------------
  // A photo food log a coach deploys for their clients. Not a chat bot: a page
  // with a camera button. People type their email once and are remembered on
  // that browser forever (a random device key, no password). Photos are read
  // by the vision model below and thrown away; only a 256 px thumbnail and
  // the numbers are kept. Barcodes (Open Food Facts), nutrition labels,
  // receipts, weigh-ins and a shared household for a spouse are all in.
  // The coach's view is /food/coach (the admin code). docs/FOOD-LOG.md.
  // Secrets: FOODLOG_PEPPER (required for real use: npx wrangler secret put
  // FOODLOG_PEPPER), and GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID / MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID / APPLE_CLIENT_ID
  // if you want "Sign in with …" to link a second device (optional).
  // What it costs (developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/platform/pricing, Sept 2026):
  //   gemma-4-26b-a4b-it  $0.10 per M input tokens, $0.30 per M output tokens.
  //   A plate photo is about 400 input + 150 output tokens ≈ 10 neurons ≈ $0.0001
  //   — a hundredth of a cent. The free 10,000 neurons a day cover ~1,000 photos.
  // foodLog: DEPRECATED here since v3.7. The food log is a bot folder now —
  // YourBots/plate/project.json with "kind": "food" and a "food": { … } block
  // (docs/FOOD-LOG.md). A foodLog block left here still works, with a warning
  // in the logs, until the next release.

  // ---- 7. LOOKS --------------------------------------------------------------
